### Creating Buffers and Array Objects

In OpenGL, the memory on your GPU where vertex data is stored is called a buffer. Buffers are OpenGL objects that store an array of unformatted memory. These can be created, used, and deleted just like any other OpenGL object. The most commonly used buffers in a simple OpenGL application are the Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and the Vertex Array Objects (VAOs).

#### Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)

A VBO is an OpenGL object that serves as a high-performance memory buffer on the GPU. Its main role is to send your vertex data to the graphics card for rendering. Here is how you usually create and fill a VBO:

```cpp
// Generate buffer ID
GLuint VBO;
glGenBuffers(1, &VBO);

// Bind the buffer
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);

// Send data to buffer
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

The `glGenBuffers()` function generates a new buffer object, taking as a parameter the number of buffers to be created. `glBindBuffer()` binds a buffer object to a specific buffer binding target, and `glBufferData()` creates and initializes the buffer object's data store.

For a deeper understanding, you may refer to the [OpenGL wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Array_Object), which is an official resource offering detailed explanations.

#### Vertex Array Object (VAO)

A VAO can be considered a 'big container' where you can store multiple VBOs. It remembers the calls made to `glEnableVertexAttribArray()` and `glVertexAttribPointer()`, thereby reducing the amount of setup code for every rendering iteration.

```cpp
// Generate VAO ID
GLuint VAO;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAO);

// Bind VAO
glBindVertexArray(VAO);
```

### Indexed Drawing with EBO

Drawing shapes using only VBOs can be inefficient if the shape contains overlapping vertices. To draw complex shapes without wasting memory on duplicate vertex data, you can use an Element Buffer Object (EBO). An EBO stores indices that point to vertices in the VBO.

Here's an example code snippet for creating an EBO:

```cpp
// Generate EBO ID
GLuint EBO;
glGenBuffers(1, &EBO);

// Bind the EBO while VAO is active
glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, EBO);

// Send indices to EBO
glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(indices), indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

The function calls are similar to those for VBOs but note that the binding target is now `GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER`. This signals to OpenGL that this buffer object is going to be used as an element buffer.

By using EBOs, you can draw complex shapes by referring to indices instead of vertices, thereby optimizing memory usage. For instance, to draw a shape using indices:

```cpp
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);
```

For more in-depth information, you can consult the [OpenGL wiki on Element Buffer Objects](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Element_Array_Buffer_Object).

By gaining a firm understanding of how buffers and indexed drawing work in OpenGL, you can optimize your applications and prepare for more advanced graphical tasks.
