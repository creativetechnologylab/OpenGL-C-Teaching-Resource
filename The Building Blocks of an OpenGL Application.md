# Understanding the Building Blocks of an OpenGL Application in C++

OpenGL is a widely used API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. This article will help you understand an example OpenGL application that performs simple 2D rendering. The code is written in C++ and makes use of libraries like GLFW, Glad, and GLM.

## The Initial Setup

First, we import all the necessary libraries. GLFW is for windowing, user input, and more; Glad helps us manage OpenGL extensions; and GLM is for mathematical operations. We also include standard libraries like `<chrono>` for timing and `<iostream>` for input-output operations.

```cpp
#include <glad/glad.h>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <glm/glm.hpp>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
```

## Function to Control Frame Rate

Before diving into the `main()` function, there's a utility function `WaitForNextFrame()`. This function ensures that the rendering loop runs at a consistent frame rate (60 FPS in this case). Using `std::chrono`, it measures the elapsed time and stalls the loop to match the desired frame duration. This is crucial for animation smoothness and gameplay consistency.

## Inside the Main Function

### Initializing GLFW

The first step is to initialize GLFW. If this fails, the program exits early. Once GLFW is initialized, a window is created where OpenGL will render the graphics.

### Setting up OpenGL Context with Glad

After window creation, the OpenGL context for that window is initialized. Glad is then used to load OpenGL function pointers. If this fails, the program exits.

### The OpenGL Rendering Pipeline

Before diving into rendering, it's essential to understand that OpenGL works in a series of steps known as the pipeline. The major steps include:

1. Define your shapes (vertices)
2. Create Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO)
3. Optionally, create an Element Buffer Object (EBO)
4. Create a Vertex Array Object (VAO)
5. Create shaders and shader programs
6. Draw the shapes in the render loop

### Shaders and Program

Shaders are tiny programs that run on the GPU. In this example, the vertex and fragment shaders are loaded from files and compiled into a shader program.

### Creating Buffers and Array Objects

Once we have our shader program, we need to pass our vertex data to the GPU. This is done using Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and Vertex Array Objects (VAOs). In this example, the VAO serves as a 'big container' that holds different kinds of vertex data.

### Indexed Drawing with EBO

An Element Buffer Object (EBO) is used to avoid data redundancy. It stores indices that point to the vertices in the VBO. This way, you can reuse vertices for drawing multiple shapes.

### The Render Loop

The heart of any OpenGL application is its render loop. This loop continues until the user decides to close the window. Within this loop, several key activities happen:

1. The frame timing is stamped.
2. The screen is cleared for new drawing.
3. The shapes are drawn on the screen.
4. The front and back buffers are swapped, making the drawn frame visible.
5. User inputs and other window events are polled and handled.
6. Frame rate is managed using `WaitForNextFrame()`.

### Clean-up

Once the loop ends (i.e., the window is closed), all the allocated resources are cleaned up to avoid memory leaks.

By understanding each of these components, you can gain a deep insight into how OpenGL applications are structured and how graphics are rendered on your screen. This understanding can serve as a foundation for more complex graphics programming endeavors.

### Creating Buffers and Array Objects

In OpenGL, the memory on your GPU where vertex data is stored is called a buffer. Buffers are OpenGL objects that store an array of unformatted memory. These can be created, used, and deleted just like any other OpenGL object. The most commonly used buffers in a simple OpenGL application are the Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and the Vertex Array Objects (VAOs).

#### Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)

A VBO is an OpenGL object that serves as a high-performance memory buffer on the GPU. Its main role is to send your vertex data to the graphics card for rendering. Here is how you usually create and fill a VBO:

```cpp
// Generate buffer ID
GLuint VBO;
glGenBuffers(1, &VBO);

// Bind the buffer
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);

// Send data to buffer
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

The `glGenBuffers()` function generates a new buffer object, taking as a parameter the number of buffers to be created. `glBindBuffer()` binds a buffer object to a specific buffer binding target, and `glBufferData()` creates and initializes the buffer object's data store.

For a deeper understanding, you may refer to the [OpenGL wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Array_Object), which is an official resource offering detailed explanations.

#### Vertex Array Object (VAO)

A VAO can be considered a 'big container' where you can store multiple VBOs. It remembers the calls made to `glEnableVertexAttribArray()` and `glVertexAttribPointer()`, thereby reducing the amount of setup code for every rendering iteration.

```cpp
// Generate VAO ID
GLuint VAO;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAO);

// Bind VAO
glBindVertexArray(VAO);
```

### Indexed Drawing with EBO

Drawing shapes using only VBOs can be inefficient if the shape contains overlapping vertices. To draw complex shapes without wasting memory on duplicate vertex data, you can use an Element Buffer Object (EBO). An EBO stores indices that point to vertices in the VBO.

Here's an example code snippet for creating an EBO:

```cpp
// Generate EBO ID
GLuint EBO;
glGenBuffers(1, &EBO);

// Bind the EBO while VAO is active
glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, EBO);

// Send indices to EBO
glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(indices), indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

The function calls are similar to those for VBOs but note that the binding target is now `GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER`. This signals to OpenGL that this buffer object is going to be used as an element buffer.

By using EBOs, you can draw complex shapes by referring to indices instead of vertices, thereby optimizing memory usage. For instance, to draw a shape using indices:

```cpp
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);
```

For more in-depth information, you can consult the [OpenGL wiki on Element Buffer Objects](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Element_Array_Buffer_Object).

By gaining a firm understanding of how buffers and indexed drawing work in OpenGL, you can optimize your applications and prepare for more advanced graphical tasks.
